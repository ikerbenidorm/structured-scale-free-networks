    "- Generate networks using the Structured Scale-Free Network model at various sizes.  \n",
    "- Compute the degree distribution and verify its theoretical match.  \n",
    "- Evaluate the clustering coefficient and compare it to theory.  \n",
    "- Determine the network dimension.  \n",
    "- Visualize the networks across different parameter values; bonus: create an animation of network assembly.  \n",
